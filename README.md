# HeartApp
Developed using React Native.  
## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/Aviv-Yaari/HeartApp.git
```

2. Install the dependencies
```
npm install
or 
yarn install
```

3. Start the app
```
npm start
or
yarn start
```
Expo DevTools should open in your browser. If it doesn't, you might need to install the Expo CLI (if you haven't already):
```
npm install --global expo-cli
or
yarn global add expo-cli
```

4. In your browser, scan the QR code on the bottom left corner of the screen with your phone (you might be prompted to install the Expo App on your phone first), or choose "Run On Android / iOS Simulator" (if you have one installed on your machine).
